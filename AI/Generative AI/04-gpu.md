# Demystifying GPUs in AI

## What are GPUs?

GPUs, or Graphics Processing Units, were initially designed for rendering graphics and video tasks. Remember the excitement of upgrading your PC with a new GPU for better gaming? That same technology has become pivotal in AI, thanks to its architecture and parallel processing capabilities.

Why are GPUs Crucial for AI?

- GPU Architecture: GPUs have thousands of small cores (organized into Streaming Multiprocessors) designed for parallel computing. This setup is perfect for AI workloads, which often require simultaneous processing of large data sets.
- Parallel Processing Power: GPUs excel at performing multiple calculations at once, making them ideal for handling the complex mathematical operations needed in AI.
- Speed and Efficiency: With rapid thread switching and high memory latency tolerance, GPUs significantly reduce the time needed for training neural networks, like GPT-3, which requires 300 zettaflops of computing power.
- AI Framework Support: Manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel have optimized GPUs for AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
