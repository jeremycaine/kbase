# AI Developer Survey

1. **Skills Gap**: Only 24% of app developers surveyed consider themselves experts in GenAI. Fast innovation cycles and a lack of standardized development frameworks are major obstacles.

2. **Tool Overload**: Developers juggle between 5â€“15 tools (or more!) to create enterprise AI apps. Yet the most critical tool qualities - performance, flexibility, ease of use, and integration - are also the rarest.

3. **Trust and Complexity**: As enterprises explore agentic AI, trustworthiness and seamless integration with broader IT systems emerge as critical concerns.

Consequence: overly complex AI stack enterprise investments and slow innovation.

Solution: Simplification
