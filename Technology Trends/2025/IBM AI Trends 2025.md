## 1. AI Agents
Intelligence systems that can reason, plan and take action.
They break down complex problems to create multi-step plans.
They can interact with tools and databases to achieve goals.

But today's models struggle with consistent logical reasoning. They can execute simple plans, but for complex scenarios with multiple various they can lose track and make decisions that don't quite add up.

*2025*: we will need better models to improve their performance.

## 2. Inference Time Compute Models
During inference, model works on real-time data comparing the user's query with information processes during training and stored in its weights.

New AI models are extending their inference processing to including some "thinking". Not really thinking, but a variable of time to execute some reasoning. This can be tuned withouth having to change the underlying model.

Reasoning can now be improved: (1) at model training time; (2) at inferecen time with better chain-of-thought training.

*2025*: look for Inference Time Compute Models.

## 3. Very Large Models
Current 2024 frontier models are 1-2 trillion parameters in size. The next generation of models could be 50 trillion parameters.

*2025*: arrival of enormous Very Large Models.

## 4. Very Small Models
Models that are only a few billion parameters. They do not need large amount of hardware resources. Example, IBM Granite 3.0 2BN model runs on laptop.

*2025*: more smaller models tuned to specific tasks.

## 5. Advanced Use Cases
Common enterprise use case for AI in 2024 were improving customer experience, IT operations and automatin, virtual assistants and cyber security.

More advance use cases like customer service bots that solve problems rather than routing tickets; security tools that can adapt to new threats in real time.

*2025*: higher expectations, advanced use cases

## 6. Near Infinite Memory
Chatbots that can keep everythin they know about us in memory at all times. They will be soon be able to recall every conversation had with us.

*2025*: large scale memory solutions

## 7. Human in the Loop Augmentation
Take the example of a chatbot tested to outperform clinical physicians. 50 doctoers were asked to diagnose medical conditions from examining case reports. The chatbot presented with same cases scored higher. 

Additionally a random selection of the doctors were assigned to use a chat bot. The doctor plus chatbot group also scored lower that the chatbot alone. That is a failinng of AI and human augmentation.

An expert paired with an effective AI system should be smarter. But prompting is hard.

*2025*: we need better systems that allow professionals to augment AI tools into their workflow, without having to be experts in prompting.
